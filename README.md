# Nurse Karen Compliance & Grievance Submittal Portal

**A Satirical AI Chat Interface**

## Overview

Welcome to the Nurse Karen Compliance & Grievance Submittal Portal! This project is a satirical AI chat interface designed to simulate an interaction with an authoritarian, easily-agitated, and hilariously unhelpful "Nurse Karen" persona. The primary objective is to create a humorous user experience through exaggerated bureaucracy and a comically difficult AI personality.

**Please Note:** This application is for entertainment and demonstration purposes only. Nurse Karen's advice is intentionally absurd and should NOT be taken as actual medical or professional guidance.

## Core Features

The portal boasts a range of features designed to enhance the satirical experience:

*   **Interactive Chat:** Engage in (often frustrating) conversations with Nurse Karen.
*   **Simulated Sentiment Analysis:** Nurse Karen reacts to perceived negativity, with user messages being "(LOGGED FOR REVIEW)".
*   **Insubordination Detection:** Use of certain keywords will be noted (and may affect your compliance).
*   **Formal Grievance System:** Users can file formal grievances, which are logged and displayed in the "Official Notifications" area.
*   **"Notify Ken" Protocol:** Repeatedly invoke Nurse Karen's ire (by using her name "Karen" in chat), and you'll unlock the option to "Notify Ken" (her influential husband), resulting in a stern warning displayed in "Official Notifications".
*   **Official Report Generation:** Use the `/generatereport` command to compile a full "incident report" of your chat history, presided over by Nurse Karen, displayed in "Official Notifications".
*   **"Evidence" Upload & AI Gaslighting:** Users can upload images as "evidence," only to have Nurse Karen provide a dismissive and irrelevant art critique in the chat.
*   **Dynamic Policy Citation:** Use the `/citepolicy [topic]` command, and Nurse Karen will generate a humorously bureaucratic and nonsensical hospital policy in the chat.
*   **Compliance Score Tracker:** Your every action is monitored via a visible score! Maintain a high compliance score, or face the consequences â€“ including color changes in the score display, and ultimately, permanent revocation of assistance privileges (chat input disabled).
*   **"Speak to the Manager" Mini-Game:** Demand to speak to a manager three times (by typing "manager" in chat), and you'll be faced with a timed typing challenge of corporate jargon. Success brings a slight compliance reprieve; failure brings further compliance penalties.

## Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
*   **Backend (Conceptual):** The application is currently client-side only. Backend interactions (like AI responses, sentiment analysis, database logging) are simulated in JavaScript. The original blueprint envisioned Google Cloud Functions (Node.js) with Vertex AI and Cloud Natural Language API for these purposes.

## Running the Application

As this is a client-side application:

1.  Clone the repository (specifically, the `karen-portal-beta` branch or `main` after merge).
2.  Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3.  Prepare for a uniquely challenging administrative experience.

## Disclaimer

This project is a work of satire and parody. The character "Nurse Karen" and her advice are fictional and intended for humorous purposes. It does not represent any real person, medical professional, or institution. Please interact responsibly and with a sense of humor!
